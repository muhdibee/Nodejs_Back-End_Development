## Concepts learnt
- Event loop:  Despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded, The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. The vent loop is a way of performing operations asyncronously (i.e performing operations using callbacks, promises or async await).
- When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.
- Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.
- When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the provided input script (or drops into the REPL, which is not covered in this document) which may make async API calls, schedule timers, or call process.nextTick(), then begins processing the event loop.
